## Project Focus

The project focus is to create a efficiently, robust and accurate software to classrooms management. The main difference between USPolis and others solutions is that USPolis is based on class/subjects and classrooms, not only classrooms and events. Since the current project focus is for university enviroment, we have developed features that help secretaries jobs, like calendars, conflicts checking, reservations (currently the only reservation is for classrooms). The software has also developed several features that facilitates the comunication between the students and the secretaries, allowing the students to solicate classrooms reservations directly by the system. At the moment we are studing the possibility to allow the admin system to manage professors schedules and people management (for courses).

## Project Principles

The main principle of USPolis is to help people, is a open-source software made by students for students and the entire university community. Is aimed to help fresh students to find were his classes are and how to get at them, also to help the buildings responsables to organize the spaces of his buildings. The original creator was a student at Polytechinic and the project is actually manteined by USP students.
